BMI as a Predictor for Diabetes
Overview
This project explores BMI as a predictor for diabetes using a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains variables such as age, hypertension, HbA1c levels, blood glucose, and diabetes status. Custom Python code was written to preprocess the data, conduct regression analysis, and visualize relationships, with a focus on understanding the correlation between BMI and diabetes.

Features Implemented
Data preprocessing:
Handling missing or improperly formatted data.
Separating variables into categorical and numerical types.
Statistical calculations:
Means, standard deviations, and maximum values.
Custom implementation of regression models.
Data visualization:
Generation of a regression line for BMI and diabetes using Matplotlib.
Summary statistics:
Displaying formatted tables with key insights.
Technologies Used
Python: Core language for development.
Libraries:
numpy: Sparse usage for numerical operations.
matplotlib: Visualization of regression results.
csv: Reading and processing the dataset.
math and copy: Utilities for custom calculations and data handling.
How to Set Up / Get Started
Dataset: Download the dataset from Kaggle. Save it as diabetes.csv in the project directory.
Dependencies: Install required libraries using:
bash
Copy code
pip install numpy matplotlib
Run the Code: Execute the script using:
bash
Copy code
python script_name.py
Replace script_name.py with the name of your script file.
Usage
The script preprocesses the data, performs regression analysis, and visualizes the relationship between BMI and diabetes. Results include a regression plot and summary statistics such as means, standard deviations, and category counts.
