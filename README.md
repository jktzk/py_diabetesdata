BMI as a Predictor for Diabetes
Overview
This project explores BMI as a predictor for diabetes using a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains variables such as age, hypertension, HbA1c levels, blood glucose, and diabetes status. Custom Python code was written to preprocess the data, conduct regression analysis, and visualize relationships, with a focus on understanding the correlation between BMI and diabetes.

Features Implemented
Data preprocessing:
Handling missing or improperly formatted data.
Separating variables into categorical and numerical types.
Statistical calculations:
Means, standard deviations, and maximum values.
Custom implementation of regression models.
Data visualization:
Generation of a regression line for BMI and diabetes using Matplotlib.
Summary statistics:
Displaying formatted tables with key insights.
